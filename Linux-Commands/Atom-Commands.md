# Atom Text Editor:    

There are several text editors, I recommend Atom for Linux/Ununtu/Debian use, which is simple and elegant from Terminal or from UI perspective.    
   
### Usage:
    
From Terminal, go to the directory with the file you want to open an execute the command `$ atom FILE_NAME`.  
    
Based on the following tutorial: https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#platform-linux.    

### Install Packages:

In order to install additional packages such as terminal within atom, from a Terminal `$ atm install PACKAGE_NAME` without sudo.

### **Installation**:

a. `$ wget -qO - https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -`  
    
b. `$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/any/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/atom.list'`  
    
c. `$ sudo apt-get update`  
    
d. `$ sudo apt-get install atom`
