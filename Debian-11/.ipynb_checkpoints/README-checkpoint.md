# Debian 11

Going forward, we will use Debian 11 for all laboratory purposes on all computers:

- Debian 11 boot guidelines
- Debian 11, give user permissions
- Debian 11, WI-FI driver


Debian and Ubuntu belong to the same side of the distribution spectrum. Debian gives you complete control over their OS setup. Therefore, due to the fact that we need to have complete control of external devices such as GPIB we are required to use Debian.
